- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m @JeffRThomas
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code.
- 🌱 My journey started with some exposure to Web Development. But learning Python maybe more beneficial to me professionally. 
- 💞️ I’d like to collaborate on opensource projects and network with the developer community.
- 📫 You can reach me on Twitter @oneofpatience
